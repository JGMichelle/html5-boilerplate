# About This Repo

This document outlines the configuration of this repo as well as the basic
process we use to manage the project. As Github has matured as a platform
and HTML5 Boilerplate has matured as a project there are a lot of lessons
to be learned from the way we run the show here.

## GitHub configuration

This section will go through the way we configure the repo in GitHub.
Open source projects get the full power of the platform in a lot of ways and
we like to experiment with new GitHub features, so our current configuration
might help you figure out some things you want to do in your own projects.
